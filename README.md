# JMETER Performance Project

##The goal of this project is to gain more experience with performance testing in software quality assurance. I keep hearing of tools
like JMeter and I need to know how it works.

I gained this knowledge of JMeter by doing various courses like Test Automation University online. 

The project will consist of building a performance test automation on a website that I need to find first.
